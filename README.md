PitchPerfect
============

PitchPerfect the first project for [Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd003). 

The app records and saves audio from the device's microphone, then allows the user to play it back at a slower or faster rate or a higher or lower pitch. It was written in Swift and it uses Apple's AVFoundation library for audio recording and playback.

Here are two screenshots:
